      <description>Training / Meet Prep
I injured my back a few months ago, so I did some powerlifting training to try to regain strength, and sometimes going to Global Strongman Gym on Saturdays to train with strongman equipment. But usually not because it was far away, and I was lazy and possibly suffering some mild depression. Pre-injury PRs: 240/135/305 lbs.
I had the choice of doing novice women&#39;s category or 140 lb women&#39;s category.</description>
