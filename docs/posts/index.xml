      <description>Training / Meet Prep
I injured my back a few months ago, so I did some powerlifting training to try to regain strength, and sometimes going to Global Strongman Gym on Saturdays to train with strongman equipment. But usually not because it was far away, and I was lazy and possibly suffering some mild depression. Pre-injury PRs: 240/135/305 lbs.
I had the choice of doing novice women&#39;s category or 140 lb women&#39;s category.</description>

 9/12/15 - 9/9, 562 lbs @ 136 lbs, 182/115/265, 278 Wilks, USAPL  Training / Meet Prep
I&#39;ve been lifting since September 2014, and I was doing Texas Method for the last few months. Since my last meet, I&#39;ve changed the rep schemes for volume day lifts from 3x5 to 5x5, which was really good for my squat, but not very good for my bench.</description>

I have been lifting for a year now. I did Starting Strength for 8 months, and Texas Method for 4. I treated meet week like a normal Texas Method week, except I also tested my openers on Monday, and I skipped intensity day Friday.</description>
