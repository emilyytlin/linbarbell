**Training / Meet Prep**

I was recovering from a low back injury in May, then I did a strongwoman competition in August, then I did Project Momentum. I mostly regained my squat and deadlift, and I improved bench a lot. Still weighing in 14 lbs under my weight class.

**Squat**

* 100 - 3/3
* 107.5 - 0/3. The bar rolled forward. This is really deep because I don't actually have any propioception.
* 107.5 - 2/3. I cut depth a bit, and I got it.

**Bench**

* 60 - 3/3
* 62.5 - 3/3
* 65 - 3/3. New 1 lb PR. Pretty happy because I've found bench to be so much harder in competition than in training.

**Deadlift**

* 120 - 3/3
* 130 - 0/3. Weight did not come up.
* 130 - 2/3. This was so tough, and I am so lopsided, but I made it! Still a post-injury PR. One of the side judges called for up/down movement. 

**Thoughts / Conclusions**

I feel kind of dumb for taking two tries to hit a squat and a deadlift that I could definitely do, but at least I got them. This was my first time travelling far far away for a meet, so with the airplane ride and not preparing food, eating is really weird, so I weighed in a few pounds less than usual. I will age out of juniors by next nationals, so I will have to hit a much higher total to qualify next year. Also, when assembling my home gym, I bought an Ohio Bar as opposed to the Ohio Power Bar, so I was training on a bar that is whippier than is used in competition, so that made deadlifts a bit harder.

Overall, I've got a PR total, and I think I did a pretty good job. I had a great time competing, watching the primetime lifters, and meeting all these strong people.

**Going forward**

* +42.5 kg total in 6 months to qualify for raw nationals in the open category
* Buy an Ohio Power Bar
* Eat food
