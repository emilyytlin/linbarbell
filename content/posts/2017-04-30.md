**Training / Meet Prep**

I got mono sometime in December, so I didn't lift for about a month, so getting back to lifting was pretty rough. Then I started  Project Momentum 2017, which went really well for me. I tried to increase the 1 @ RPE 8 singles by 2.5 lbs/week for bench and its variations and 5-10 lbs/week for sqaut/deadlift and its variations. I technically did not finish the program because I got sick one week and had to push everything back a week, which worked well for this meet, but the deadline for the questionnaire was 4/26, so I filled it out with my current PRs, which was still a big improvement. Sorry Mike T.

**Thoughts / Conclusions**

I'm really happy with this meet because I got a lot stronger and picked some great attempts. I got 4th place in open and 2nd in juniors. I qualify for raw nationals as a junior, but I'm going to age out of it by October, and my total is 12.5 kg away from the open limit, so I cannot lift there.

**Going forward**

* Eat more food, as usual
* Qualify for USAPL raw nationals 2018
* idk really. Get coaching? Do a strongwoman meet? Buy more lifting toys? Go to sleep?
